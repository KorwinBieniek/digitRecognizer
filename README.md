# Digit Recognizer 🎰
The user can draw a digit and a neural network will try to predict what it is

## Code Requirements ☀️
requirements.py script to install all the depencies will be added in the future

## Description 🏦
The network was using two convolutional layers with the ReLU activation function.
Next it used 3 layers after flattening.
The result for the testing set was 0.9987, although the graphical interface uses different form of creation of the digits than the dataset it was training on. 
The recognition is lower than the one used on the dataset.

Click 'Predict' after drawing the numbers to use the model for the digit prediction.
Click 'Clear' to clear the drawing window.

## Python  Implementation 👨‍🔬

1) Dataset- MNIST dataset
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify digits from 0 to 9
4) Model was trained using the Convolutional Neural Network
